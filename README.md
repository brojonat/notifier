# notifier

## What is this?

I was reading [this post](https://brandur.org/notifier) on HackerNews and decided I'd implement my own `notifier` package because I had some projects in mind that would benefit from some PubSub. So, that's what this is. I have my own blog post [here](https://brojonat.com/posts/go-postgres-listen-notify/) that goes over some of the details. This is a WIP as I build it out for a few different use cases, but feel free to drop an Issue or PR if you see something out of whack.
